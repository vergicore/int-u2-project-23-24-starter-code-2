  <h2>"Gun violence is a daily scourge that threatens our most fundamental right: the right to life. More than 600
    people die every day as a result of firearms violence, which is driven in part by easy access to firearms â€“ whether
    legal or illegal." -Amnesty International</h2>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Gun Violence is an enduring issue that has gone on for centuries. Every day, more than 600 people die due to
        incidents involving firearms. This is partially caused by how easy it is to actually acquire a fire arm, whether
        through legal, or illegal means. The people affected by this problem the most have been found to usually be
        people of color, deprived communities, or other marginalized groups. These incidents are harmful because they
        can disrupt our access to healthcare and education as people may be too scared to go out and attend these
        facilities because of the presence of firearms in their communities</p>

      <h2>How can we help? </h2>
      <p>Some solutions that could help to prevent gun violence are...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stricter firearm laws: The laws will make it harder for people to have acess to dangerous weapons.</li>
        <li>Establishing a culture of gun safety: Requiring safe and secure storage of firearms, mandatory firearm
          training, required licences, and reducing access of firearms to the youth and young individuals who could
          potentially harm themselves are all good first steps to preventing gun violence and creating a safer
          environment.</li>
        <li>Advance gun safety and self-defense technology: Innovating new technology that can help people defend themselves and enhance gun safety are all good ways to prevent and stop gun violence. </li>
      </ol>
